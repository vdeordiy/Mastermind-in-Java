## Background:

A fun, juggling man from a nearby circus challenges you to a game of guessing. ü§´ Can you guess his secret combination of colors and overcome his silly antics? If so, you are in for a treat! üç¨

## How to play

```
cd bin
java App
```

There are six colors: Red, Green, Blue, Magenta, Orange, and Dark

Press <kbd>R</kbd> on your keyboard to select Red, or <kbd>1</kbd>. Likewise for other colors.

<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> to guess

<kbd>Backspace</kbd> to undo

If you see green, that means you got one color placed correctly.

And if you see yellow, that means you found one color in the secret sequence.
